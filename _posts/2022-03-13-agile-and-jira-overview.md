# Agile with Atlassioan Jira

## What is Agile?
Agile is an approach to managing and working on projects. It is a simple approach to managing complexity.
* Use Cases include Software dev; Managing ticket services; Writing a book; Building a rocket.

## Characteristics of Agile Projects

**incremental** ->  plan, develop and release increments
**iterative** -> continuously imptove the product and process of building the product
**Focus on values** -> the team focus on the current most important aspect of the product, and then after that increment, the team decide about the next highest value job of the product to focus on again. it is based on the continuous feedback on the product and of the users of the product.
**An empowered team** -> members of the team are placed to make quick and good decision. It is very collaborative. team is like a distributive brain where each member got some information to could complete the other member. each member continuously helps make decision.


## Continuous Learning through iterations

### The Scientic Method
**1. Create an hypothesis**
**2. Build an Experiment**
**3. Observe/Learn ffrom the result**
**4. Repeat/Iterate**
 
 Plan ->  Build -> Release , that is the agile approach.
 Agile project use an experimental approach.

### The Waterfall approach
It is to plan and develop the whole project in phases (through time)
ANALYSE -> DESIGN -> BUILD -> TEST -> RELEASE 

Some consequences of the waterfall approach :
* change is hard and expensive. 
* lot of obselete documents ( waste of time)
* feedbacks are drastically delayed

The waterfall approach may be good if the project is very predicatble. Therefore we can enjoy economic of scale.


## JIRA Overview
Tool to work with Agile approach. It is build in hierachy.
* At the application level => Jira is a collection of projets. The entry point to the application, to Jira, is a project. Jira is a collection of projects. A user can have access to one or more projects.
* At the project level => A Project is a collection of issues. An issue is problem or a task or a work to be done (??). In a project, we could have many issues to solve.
* At the issue level, inside a project => An issue is a collection of work item. An Issue could be divided into many items to work on.

There three type of agile tool to use in Jira : Scrum, Kanban, and Business. The Scrum one is more project management oriented where we can have backlogs listing many stories (user stories) and then each stories composed of one or more tasks. Wherease in Kanban, we talk not like in Scrum case, we are more focused on product developpemnt, thus, we articuale in term of issues (like stories) and for each issues we could have one more items (work items). May be I am wrong. issues and work items are the same?? 

In our case, when worked on the exercises, we created an issue inside a project, and then within the issue, we created many items. Those items are found in the backlog as list. Therefore, an issue is a story (a User Story in the case of the Scrum) and an item is a task. We can have many task to accomplish in order to finish a story.

## Configure a Company-managed Kanban Board

The Kanban Template => the kanban board
* The Workflow : the set of columns of a board represent a workflow for completing the workd of an issue.
* Workflows are broken down into steps (statuses, states, or stages) (selected for dev, in progress, done)

A single project can multiple boards!!!
* Boards are a view of issues arranged by status
* Moving an issue change the value of its status field (transition)
* the first status of a board is backlog, and then selected for Dev, In Progress, Done.
* simplified wk is Jira managed wk
* If **Set Resolution** is checked, Jira considers the issue resolved (closed)
