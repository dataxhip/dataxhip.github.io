On this site hosted by github, I will display all the projects I am working on.

## Big-Learn
Big Data, throughout distributed computing and storage, help to tacle many problems ralated to data velocity, variability, and volume. 
Learning at scale is still a challenge, because we need to adapt training algorithms. In that case, I working in building data applications with Spark (Spark ML, Spark-Core, Spark-Streaming), Hadoop (HDFS, Hive, MapReduce), Kafka, and Nifi.

## Auto-Learn
Thanks to the Data Science community (Kaggle, Quantopian, etc...), best learning algorithms for a given problem or task are mainly known, the value added in more on the automation side. Auto-Learn is an interactive learning algorithm. It is to process a learning problem interactively in such way, the user take a hand on everything the achine is doing, like reading, cleaning, visualizing, training, and so on. Many auto learning algorithms do the process underhood and act like a blackbox. In this project, I incorporate my own knowledge base techning on Machine learning like explanable AI,feature selection strategy, underfitting overfitting trade-off, automatic visualization,...

## DataXhip
Thanks to cloud computing, compute and storage don't no more cost a thing. How about therefore creating data in anything? We could start with Open Data and then make it more interesting through Synthetic Data generation from it.
DataXhip mixes Open Data and Synthetic Data to propose data solution related to a given sector and to solve a given problem.

## Data-Ops
The project aim at leveraging on containerized solutions with Docker, their orchestration and deployemnt with kubernetes or Docker-Compose. Ansible,  an automation and orchestration technology helps pushing this project to another level.

## IA-Engine
This project is all about nurturing my knowledges in Artificial Intelligence. I am currently enrolled in many online classes, Like OpenClassRoom IA Engineer class and DeepLearning.ai course on Coursera. Here below, I will tag all publications that I will produce through this process.

## PRAIDIC
PRAIDIC uses AI to track and predict financial market asset prices.
